# L&T Vehicle Loan Default Prediction 🚗💰  

This project aims to predict loan default risks for vehicle loans using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical loan data, borrower profiles, and financial indicators, we build predictive models to identify potential defaulters, helping lenders mitigate risks.  

### 🔍 **Key Highlights:**  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Data Analysis:** Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision-Recall, ROC-AUC Score  

### 📌 **Objectives:**  
✔ Identify key factors influencing loan default  
✔ Build and compare predictive models  
✔ Improve financial decision-making through data-driven insights
